Welcome to XML DOM!
###################

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform- and language-independent interface that represents HTML and XML documents as a tree structure. It allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and manipulate a document’s content, structure, and style.

The **HTML DOM** provides a standard way to access and modify HTML elements. For example, using `document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";` updates the content of an HTML element with the specified ID.

The **XML DOM** treats XML documents as a collection of node objects. Each element, attribute, text, or comment in the XML is considered a node. These nodes can be accessed and modified through standard properties and methods.

**Common XML DOM Properties** include:
- `nodeName` – name of the node  
- `nodeValue` – value of the node  
- `parentNode`, `childNodes`, and `attributes` – access to relationships and attributes

**Common Methods** include:
- `getElementsByTagName()` – returns a list of elements by tag name  
- `appendChild()` – adds a node  
- `removeChild()` – removes a node  

Understanding the DOM is crucial for developers, as it enables dynamic interaction with web content using JavaScript in both HTML and XML documents.
