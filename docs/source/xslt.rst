Welcome to XSLT!
################

XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a powerful language used to transform XML documents into HTML. Unlike CSS, XSLT allows adding, removing, sorting, and conditionally displaying elements. It uses XPath to access data in the XML. An example shows how an XML menu is transformed into styled HTML using XSLT.

XQuery is a powerful language designed for querying and extracting data from XML documents, similar to how SQL is used with databases. Built on XPath, it allows filtering, sorting, and retrieving XML data. XQuery is supported by major databases and is a W3C recommendation. It can be used for tasks like generating reports, transforming XML to XHTML, or powering web services.

XLink enables creating hyperlinks in XML documents, similar to HTML links but more flexible. Any XML element can act as a link, and the link behavior is defined using attributes like xlink:type, xlink:href, xlink:show, and xlink:actuate. XLink supports simple, extended, and embedded links. However, it has limited browser supportâ€”mainly used in SVG.

XPointer works with XLink to point to specific parts of an XML document using XPath expressions. It allows linking directly to elements with id attributes within another XML document. Though not supported by browsers, XPointer is used in other XML-based applications for fine-grained navigation.
