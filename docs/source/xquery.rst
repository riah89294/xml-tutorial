Welcome to XQUERY!
##################


XQuery is a powerful language designed to query, extract, and manipulate data from XML documents, similar to SQL for databases.

XQuery is a language designed for querying and extracting elements and attributes from XML documents. It is useful for tasks like selecting specific data, such as finding all CD records priced below $10 from a file like cd_catalog.xml. XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 share the same data model, functions, and operators, making XQuery easy to learn for those familiar with XPath.

XQuery can be applied in many ways, such as extracting information for web services, generating summary reports, transforming XML data into XHTML, and searching web documents for relevant content. It is compatible with other important W3C standards, including XML, Namespaces, XSLT, XPath, and XML Schema.

XQuery 1.0 was officially recognized as a W3C Recommendation in 2007, establishing it as a standard language for working with XML data.
